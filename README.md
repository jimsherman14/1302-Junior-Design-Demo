Simian is a mobile application designed to help newcomers to stock trading gain a stronger understanding of the what, how, and why of trading. Simon provides first-class educational support while also recommending safe and simple strategies to avoid losses.

## Development

Clone the repository and install the dependencies with npm:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:jimsherman14/1302-Junior-Design-Demo.git
cd 1302-Junior-Design-Demo
npm install
```

Change the directory into the `ios` folder and run the following command to install the SDK pod with [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/):

```bash
cd ios
pod install
```

You should see the `A0Auth0` pod being installed and linked to the sample app.

## Usage

Run your app on an emulator, simulator, or your own connected device.

- To run the app on iOS run `npm run ios`.
- To run the app on Android run `npm run android`.

The first run may take a while to fully launch. Keep an eye out for confirmation windows and watch the terminal for output and results.
